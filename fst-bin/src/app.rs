const ABOUT: &str = "\
A command line tool for building, searching and inspecting FSTs.
";

const ABOUT_CSV: &str = "\
Emit information in CSV format about the transducer.

If <output> is not set, then CSV data is emitted to stdout.
";

const ABOUT_DOT: &str = "\
Emit this transducer in the \"dot\" format.

If <output> is not set, then the \"dot\" description is emitted to stdout.

Generally, usage of this command should look like this:

    $ fst dot your-transducer.fst | dot -Tpng > your-transducer.png
    $ $YOUR_FAVORITE_IMAGE_VIEWER your-transducer.png

Where 'dot' is a command line utility that is part of graphviz.

If your transducer contains output values, then they are shown as labels on
transitions. Zero output values are omitted.
";

const ABOUT_DUPES: &str = "\
A simple way to show duplicate nodes.

This is meant to be a diagnostic tool to view duplicate nodes in the
transducer. Every duplicate node represents a missed opportunity for more
compression. A minimal transducer should have precisely zero duplicate nodes.

WARNING: This stores all nodes in the transducer in memory, decompressed. This
may be expensive in both time and space depending on the size of your
transducer.

If <output> is omitted, then diagnostic data is emitted to stdout.
";

const ABOUT_FUZZY: &str = "\
Issues a fuzzy query against the given transducer.

A fuzzy query returns all search results within a particular edit distance
of the query given.

WARNING: This works by building a Levenshtein automaton, which is currently
rather expensive (in time and space) with a big edit distance. This will be
improved in the future.
";

const ABOUT_GREP: &str = "\
Searches a transducer with a regular expression.

WARNING: This works by building a regular expression automaton, which can be
quite expensive depending on how big the regex is. If this becomes a problem,
consider disabling Unicode support in the regex via '(?-u)'.
";

const ABOUT_MAP: &str = "\
Creates an ordered map backed by a finite state transducer.

The input to this command should be a CSV file with exactly two columns and no
headers. The first column should be the key and the second column should be a
value that can be interpreted as an unsigned 64 bit integer.

If your input is already sorted, then pass the --sorted flag to make
construction much faster. If you use --sorted and the data is not sorted,
then this will return an error when it sees an out-of-order key.
";

const ABOUT_NODE: &str = "\
Shows a single node from the transducer.

The input to this command is the node's address. An address may be found either
from debugging a transducer in code, or from the output of the 'fst csv'
command.

If the address does not point to a valid node, then the executable may panic or
abort without ceremony.
";

const ABOUT_RANGE: &str = "\
Issues a range query against the given transducer.

A range query returns all search results within a particular.

If neither the start or the end of the range is specified, then all entries
in the transducer are shown.
";

const ABOUT_RUST: &str = "\
Emit Rust source code for the given FST.

This reads the FST given and emits it as Rust source code with one
constant defined:

    {NAME}_BYTES

And a `lazy_static!` ref for:

    {NAME}

Where {NAME} is taken from the name given as an argument.

The latter definition corresponds to calling `Fst::new({NAME}_BYTES)`.
This makes it possible to trivially use pre-built FSTs in your program.
";

const ABOUT_SET: &str = "\
Creates an ordered set backed by a finite state transducer.

The input to this command should be one or more files with one key per line.

If your input is already sorted, then pass the --sorted flag to make
construction much faster. If you use --sorted and the data is not sorted,
then this will return an error when it sees an out-of-order key.
";

const ABOUT_UNION: &str = "\
Unions all of the transducer inputs into a single transducer.

Any output values are dropped. Stated differently, the resulting transducer is
always a set.

Usage:
    fst union [options] <input>... <output>
    fst union --help

Options:
    -h, --help       Show this help message.
    -f, --force      Overwrites the output if a file already exists.
