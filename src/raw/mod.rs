/*!
Operations on raw finite state transducers.

This sub-module exposes the guts of a finite state transducer. Many parts of
it, such as construction and traversal, are mirrored in the `set` and `map`
sub-modules. Other parts of it, such as direct access to nodes and transitions
in the transducer, do not have any analog.

# Overview of types

`Fst` is a read only interface to pre-constructed finite state transducers.
`Node` is a read only interface to a single node in a transducer. `Builder` is
used to create new finite state transducers. (Once a transducer is created, it
can never be modified.) `Stream` is a stream of all inputs and outputs in a
transducer. `StreamBuilder` builds range queries. `OpBuilder` collects streams
and executes set operations like `union` or `intersection` on them with the
option of specifying a merge strategy for output values.

Most of the rest of the types are streams from set operations.

/// An acyclic deterministic finite state transducer.
///
/// # How does it work?
///
/// The short answer: it's just like a prefix trie, which compresses keys
/// based only on their prefixes, except that a automaton/transducer also
/// compresses suffixes.
///
/// The longer answer is that keys in an automaton are stored only in the
/// transitions from one state to another. A key can be acquired by tracing
/// a path from the root of the automaton to any match state. The inputs along
/// each transition are concatenated. Once a match state is reached, the
/// concatenation of inputs up until that point corresponds to a single key.
///
/// But why is it called a transducer instead of an automaton? A finite state
/// transducer is just like a finite state automaton, except that it has output
/// transitions in addition to input transitions. Namely, the value associated
/// with any particular key is determined by summing the outputs along every
/// input transition that leads to the key's corresponding match state.
///
/// This is best demonstrated with a couple images. First, let's ignore the
/// "transducer" aspect and focus on a plain automaton.
///
/// Consider that your keys are abbreviations of some of the months in the
/// Gregorian calendar:
///
/// ```ignore
/// jan
/// feb
/// mar
/// apr
/// may
/// jun
/// jul
/// ```
///
/// The corresponding automaton that stores all of these as keys looks like
/// this:
///
/// ![finite state automaton](http://burntsushi.net/stuff/months-set.png)
///
/// Notice here how the prefix and suffix of `jan` and `jun` are shared.
/// Similarly, the prefixes of `jun` and `jul` are shared and the prefixes
/// of `mar` and `may` are shared.
///
/// All of the keys from this automaton can be enumerated in lexicographic
/// order by following every transition from each node in lexicographic
/// order. Since it is acyclic, the procedure will terminate.
///
/// A key can be found by tracing it through the transitions in the automaton.
/// For example, the key `aug` is known not to be in the automaton by only
/// visiting the root state (because there is no `a` transition). For another
/// example, the key `jax` is known not to be in the set only after moving
/// through the transitions for `j` and `a`. Namely, after those transitions
/// are followed, there are no transitions for `x`.
///
/// Notice here that looking up a key is proportional the length of the key
/// itself. Namely, lookup time is not affected by the number of keys in the
/// automaton!
///
/// Additionally, notice that the automaton exploits the fact that many keys
/// share common prefixes and suffixes. For example, `jun` and `jul` are
/// represented with no more states than would be required to represent either
/// one on its own. Instead, the only change is a single extra transition. This
/// is a form of compression and is key to how the automatons produced by this
/// crate are so small.
///
/// Let's move on to finite state transducers. Consider the same set of keys
/// as above, but let's assign their numeric month values:
///
/// ```ignore
/// jan,1
/// feb,2
/// mar,3
/// apr,4
/// may,5
/// jun,6
/// jul,7
/// ```
///
/// The corresponding transducer looks very similar to the automaton above,
/// except outputs have been added to some of the transitions:
///
/// ![finite state transducer](http://burntsushi.net/stuff/months-map.png)
///
/// All of the operations with a transducer are the same as described above
/// for automatons. Additionally, the same compression techniques are used:
/// common prefixes and suffixes in keys are exploited.
///
/// The key difference is that some transitions have been given an output.
/// As one follows input transitions, one must sum the outputs as they
/// are seen. (A transition with no output represents the additive identity,
/// or `0` in this case.) For example, when looking up `feb`, the transition
/// `f` has output `2`, the transition `e` has output `0`, and the transition
/// `b` also has output `0`. The sum of these is `2`, which is exactly the
/// value we associated with `feb`.
///
/// For another more interesting example, consider `jul`. The `j` transition
/// has output `1`, the `u` transition has output `5` and the `l` transition
/// has output `1`. Summing these together gets us `7`, which is again the
/// correct value associated with `jul`. Notice that if we instead looked up
/// the `jun` key, then the `n` transition would be followed instead of the
/// `l` transition, which has no output. Therefore, the `jun` key equals
/// `1+5+0=6`.
///
/// The trick to transducers is that there exists a unique path through the
/// transducer for every key, and its outputs are stored appropriately along
/// this path such that the correct value is returned when they are all summed
/// together. This process also enables the data that makes up each value to be
/// shared across many values in the transducer in exactly the same way that
/// keys are shared. This is yet another form of compression!
///
/// # Bonus: a billion strings
///
/// The amount of compression one can get from automata can be absolutely
/// ridiuclous. Consider the particular case of storing all billion strings
/// in the range `0000000001-1000000000`, e.g.,
///
/// ```ignore
/// 0000000001
/// 0000000002
/// ...
/// 0000000100
/// 0000000101
/// ...
/// 0999999999
/// 1000000000
/// ```
///
/// The corresponding automaton looks like this:
///
/// ![finite state automaton - one billion strings]
/// (http://burntsushi.net/stuff/one-billion.png)
///
/// Indeed, the on disk size of this automaton is a mere **251 bytes**.
///
/// Of course, this is a bit of a pathological best case, but it does serve
/// to show how good compression can be in the optimal case.
///
/// Also, check out the
/// [corresponding transducer](http://burntsushi.net/stuff/one-billion-map.svg)
/// that maps each string to its integer value. It's a bit bigger, but still
/// only takes up **896 bytes** of space on disk. This demonstrates that
/// output values are also compressible.
///
/// # Does this crate produce minimal transducers?
///
/// For any non-trivial sized set of keys, it is unlikely that this crate will
/// produce a minimal transducer. As far as this author knows, guaranteeing a
/// minimal transducer requires working memory proportional to the number of
/// states. This can be quite costly and is anathema to the main design goal of
/// this crate: provide the ability to work with gigantic sets of strings with
/// constant memory overhead.
///
/// Instead, construction of a finite state transducer uses a cache of
/// states. More frequently used states are cached and reused, which provides
/// reasonably good compression ratios. (No comprehensive benchmarks exist to
/// back up this claim.)
///
/// It is possible that this crate may expose a way to guarantee minimal
/// construction of transducers at the expense of exorbitant memory
/// requirements.
